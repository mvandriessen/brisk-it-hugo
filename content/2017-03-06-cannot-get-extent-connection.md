When I got into the office this morning, I noticed that on particular copy job hadn't done its\` job over the weekend. This particular job copies the daily restore points to a separate scale-out repository and enforces the GFS scheme that's been set.

The job report displayed

Not that much to go on if you ask me. First, I checked to see if all extents in the repository still had enough room, this was the case.Â While I was doing that, I verified that all my proxies were still up and running. Before heading to my good friend Google, I decided to remove the copy jobÂ restore points from the configuration.

After this, I did a rescan of the repository and retriedÂ the job. It ran without a hitch, a nice and easy fix ðŸ™‚ I hope this won't become a common thing, time will tell.
