Next week, the **14th of June**, it's time for one of my favorite times of the year, the yearly VMUGBE is upon us! It's an amazing day filled with great sessions, good conversations, all set in a lovely venue.

The Belgian VMUG was the first VMUG I ever attended, 4 years ago already. It's where I met a lot of people I know in the community and, on a personal level, where I learned to just go up to random people and start talking to them. Something I'm still not very good at but there's plenty of VMUGs to come!

## Why you should attend

VMUGBE+ is a free event that gets top-notch speakers every year with topics ranging from more traditional topics to newer topics like CNA, VMware cloud on AWS and so on.

Coming to the VMUG is also a great opportunity to meet new people that are a part of the same #vCommunity we are all part of. Undoubtedly, everyone has found a solution to their problem on the blog of someone from the community. This is your chance to talk to them and perhaps even thank them!

Since 2013 VMUGBE has become VMUGBE+, which means that the organization will donate an amount of the earnings to a charity in Belgium. This ties in nicely to the whole idea of giving back to the community. You can read more about it [here](https://www.vmug.be/#exhibitors).

## Sessions I'm looking forward to

As I said before, VMUGBE has a lot of great sessions but there are a few that I'm really looking forward to attending!

**Opening keynote - [Joe Baguley](https://twitter.com/JoeBaguley)** - 4 years ago the keynote was also given by Joe Baguley, I still remember it very well. He is the CTO for EMEA and will be talking about how architectures are changing and some new areas of R&D within VMware

**VDI by day, compute by night - [Johan Van Amersfoort][(https://twitter.com/vhojan)** - I have missed this session at the NLVMUG and Empower in Lisbon, there's no way I'm missing it now!

**Kubernetes for the vSphere admin - [Eric De Witte](https://twitter.com/vEDW)** - This is a topic that I don't know a lot about. Looking forward to getting a better understanding of Kubernetes in this session. I also heard it involves rockets!

**vExpert Community Session - [Stijn Depril](https://twitter.com/sdepril)** - One of the sessions I'm looking forward to the most! Stijn is one of Belgium's vExpert Pro and a big advocate for the community. The goal of this session is to educate people on what a vExpert is and to get people excited about becoming a vExpert!

## Presenting

This VMUG will be special for me, as I will be presenting for the first time! VVOLs is something that's been talked about since 2011 but to many people it's still shrouded in mystery. The goal of my session is to dispel some of this mystery and get people excited about what VVOLs can do for your environment.

As you can see, there's a lot to look forward to. So what are you waiting for? It's not too late to register! [https://www.vmug.be/#register](https://www.vmug.be/#register)

**DO IT NOW**

I look forward to seeing you all there!
